        <p>A games tester is someone who works for video game production companies to thoroughly
            test video games before the final version is released to the public. Also known as beta
            game testers, games testers receive a version of a game that is close to its final stages.
            They must then play the game a number of times, from start to finish, in order to uncover
              bugs or glitches within the game.</p>
        <p>Without games testers, bugs and glitches would abound in games, possibly making them
            unplayable and destroying the reputation of the video game production company.</p>
        <p>Games testers are needed for every platform and genre. Depending on the location and the
            company, testers will play games on XBox, Playstation, Nintendo Wii and PC platforms. Role
            playing games, massively multi-player online games, action games, and learning games are
            just some of the genres of games that a game tester must play and thoroughly evaluate prior
            to release.</p>
